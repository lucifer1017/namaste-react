npm install -D tailwindcss postcss
npx tailwindcss init // this creates the tailwind.config.js file.

using these commands, we installed tailwindcss and postcss into our app. postcss is a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript.
So basically, tailwindcss uses postcss behind the scenes. Now, we ought to a config file for post css, so in our root directory,
we create a  .postcssrc file. Now, parcel needs postcss to understand tailwindcss. In tailwind.config.js file, 
we add "./src/**/*.{html,js,ts,jsx,tsx}", in content array, this means the contetnt attributes now knows list of types of files 
where tailwind can be used. Now we paste, @tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities; 
inside our index.css file and delete everything else. From here on, no more code will be written inside index.css file.
tailwindcss gives you className for every css that you want to write.
That being done, we start applying className's to the JSX elements. Also, with tailwind intellisense installed, when hovered on the className, it shows the actual css
it applies.
